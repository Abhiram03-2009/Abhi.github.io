    <h3> The Rules </h3>
    <p>
Basketball is a team sport.
Two teams of five players each try to score by shooting a ball through a hoop elevated 10 feet above the ground.
The game is played on a rectangular floor called the court, and there is a hoop at each end.
The court is divided into two main sections by the mid-court line.
If the offensive team puts the ball into play behind the mid-court line, it has ten seconds to get the ball over the mid-court line.
If it doesn't, then the defense gets the ball.
Once the offensive team gets the ball over the mid-court line, it can no longer have possession of the ball in the area behind the midcourt line.
If it does, the defense is awarded the ball.
  </p>

<h3> Points </h3>
  <p>
    When a team makes a basket, they score two points and the ball goes to the other team.
If a basket, or field goal, is made outside of the three-point arc, then that basket is worth three points. A free throw is worth one point.
Free throws are awarded to a team according to some formats involving the number of fouls committed in a half and/or the type of foul committed.
Fouling a shooter always results in two or three free throws being awarded the shooter, depending upon where he was when he shot. If he was beyond the three-point line, then he gets three shots.
Other types of fouls do not result in free throws being awarded until a certain number have accumulated during a half (called “team fouls”).
Once that number is reached, then the player who was fouled is awarded a '1-and-1' opportunity. If he makes his first free throw, he gets to attempt a second. If he misses the first shot, the ball is live on the rebound.
