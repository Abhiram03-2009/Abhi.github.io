    <h2> The Rules </h2>
    <p>
Basketball is a team sport.
Two teams of five players each try to score by shooting a ball through a hoop elevated 10 feet above the ground.
The game is played on a rectangular floor called the court, and there is a hoop at each end.
The court is divided into two main sections by the mid-court line.
If the offensive team puts the ball into play behind the mid-court line, it has ten seconds to get the ball over the mid-court line.
If it doesn't, then the defense gets the ball.
Once the offensive team gets the ball over the mid-court line, it can no longer have possession of the ball in the area behind the midcourt line.
If it does, the defense is awarded the ball.
  </p>
  <br>
<h2> Points </h2>
  <p>
    When a team makes a basket, they score two points and the ball goes to the other team.
If a basket, or field goal, is made outside of the three-point arc, then that basket is worth three points. A free throw is worth one point.
Free throws are awarded to a team according to some formats involving the number of fouls committed in a half and/or the type of foul committed.
Fouling a shooter always results in two or three free throws being awarded the shooter, depending upon where he was when he shot. If he was beyond the three-point line, then he gets three shots.
Other types of fouls do not result in free throws being awarded until a certain number have accumulated during a half (called “team fouls”).
Once that number is reached, then the player who was fouled is awarded a '1-and-1' opportunity. If he makes his first free throw, he gets to attempt a second. If he misses the first shot, the ball is live on the rebound.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2> Game Clock </h2>
  <p>
    Each game is divided into sections, and all levels have two halves.
In college, each half is twenty minutes long.
In high school and below, the halves are divided into eight (and sometimes, six) minute quarters. In the pros, quarters are twelve minutes long.
There is a gap of several minutes between halves. Gaps between quarters are relatively short.
If the score is tied at the end of regulation, then overtime periods of various lengths are played until a winner emerges.
 </p>
  <br>
<h2> Basket Assignment and Tip-Off </h2>
  <p>
    Also, each team is assigned a basket or goal to defend.
This means that the other basket is their scoring basket.
At halftime, the teams switch goals.
The game begins with one player from either team at center court.
A referee will toss the ball up between the two. The player that gets his hands on the ball will tip it to a teammate. This is called a tip-off.
  </p>
 <br>
<h2> Fouls and Violations </h2>
<p>
  In addition to stealing the ball from an opposing player, there are other ways for a team to get the ball.
One such way is if the other team commits a foul or violation.
FOULS
Personal fouls: Personal fouls include any type of illegal physical contact.
•	Hitting
•	Pushing
•	Slapping
•	Holding
•	Illegal pick/screen- when an offensive player is moving. When an offensive player sticks out a limb and makes physical contact with a defender in an attempt to block the path of the defender.
  Personal foul penalties- If a player is shooting while a being fouled, then he gets two free throws if his shot doesn't go in, but only one free throw if his shot does go in.
•	Three free throws are awarded if the player is fouled while shooting for a three-point goal and they miss their shot. If a player is fouled while shooting a three-point shot and makes it anyway, he is awarded one free throw. Thus, he could score four points on the play.
•	Inbounds- If fouled while not shooting, the ball is given to the team the foul was committed upon. They get the ball at the nearest side or baseline, out of bounds, and have 5 seconds to pass the ball onto the court.
•	One & one- If the team committing the foul has seven or more fouls in the game, then the player who was fouled is awarded one free throw. If he makes his first shot, then he is awarded another free throw.
•	Ten or more fouls- If the team committing the foul has ten or more fouls, then the fouled player receives two free throws.
Charging- An offensive foul that is committed when a player pushes or runs over a defensive player. The ball is given to the team that the foul was committed upon.
Blocking- Blocking is illegal personal contact resulting from a defender not establishing position in time to prevent an opponent's drive to the basket.
Flagrant foul- Violent contact with an opponent. This includes hitting, kicking, and punching. This type of foul results in free throws plus the offense retaining possession of the ball after the free throws.
Intentional foul- When a player makes physical contact with another player with no reasonable effort to steal the ball. It is a judgment call for the officials.
Technical foul- Technical foul. A player or a coach can commit this type of foul. It does not involve player contact or the ball but is instead about the 'manners' of the game. Foul language, obscenity, obscene gestures, and even arguing can be considered a technical foul, as can technical details regarding filling in the scorebook improperly or dunking during warm-ups.


VIOLATIONS
Walking/Traveling- Taking more than 'a step and a half' without dribbling the ball is traveling. Moving your pivot foot once you've stopped dribbling is traveling.
Carrying/palming- When a player dribbles the ball with his hand too far to the side of or, sometimes, even under the ball.
Double Dribble- Dribbling the ball with both hands on the ball at the same time or picking up the dribble and then dribbling again is a double dribble.
Held ball- Occasionally, two or more opposing players will gain possession of the ball at the same time. In order to avoid a prolonged and/or violent tussle, the referee stops the action and awards the ball to one team or the other on a rotating basis.
Goaltending- If a defensive player interferes with a shot while it's on the way down toward the basket, while it's on the way up toward the basket after having touched the backboard, or while it's in the cylinder above the rim, it's goaltending and the shot counts. If committed by an offensive player, it's a violation and the ball is awarded to the opposing team for a throw-in.
Backcourt violation- Once the offense has brought the ball across the mid-court line, they cannot go back across the line during possession. If they do, the ball is awarded to the other team to pass inbounds.
Time restrictions- A player passing the ball inbounds has five seconds to pass the ball. If he does not, then the ball is awarded to the other team. Other time restrictions include the rule that a player cannot have the ball for more than five seconds when being closely guarded and, in some states and levels, shot-clock restrictions requiring a team to attempt a shot within a given time frame.
</p>
<br>
<h2> Player Positions </h2>
<p>
  Center- Centers are generally your tallest players. They generally are positioned near the basket.
Offensive- The center's goal is to get open for a pass and to shoot. They are also responsible for blocking defenders, known as picking or screening, to open other players up for driving to the basket for a goal. Centers are expected to get some offensive rebounds and put-backs.
Defensive- On defense, the center's main responsibility is to keep opponents from shooting by blocking shots and passes in the key area. They also are expected to get a lot of rebounds because they're taller.
Forward- Your next tallest players will most likely be your forwards. While a forward may be called upon to play under the hoop, they may also be required to operate in the wings and corner areas.
Offensive- Forwards are responsible to get free for a pass, take outside shots, drive for goals, and rebound.
Defensive- Responsibilities include preventing drives to the goal and rebounding.
Guard- These are potentially your shortest players and they should be really good at dribbling fast, seeing the court, and passing. It is their job to bring the ball down the court and set up offensive plays.
Offensive- Dribbling, passing, and setting up offensive plays are a guard's main responsibilities. They also need to be able to drive to the basket and to shoot from the perimeter.
Defensive- On defense, a guard is responsible for stealing passes, contesting shots, preventing drives to the hoop, and for boxing out.

<h2 Basic Rules </h2>
<p>
  1. During The Game
First thing first, you need to know the time period of the game. Knowing the time helps a lot to plan and scoring goals when your team needs it desperately.
The duration in NBA tournaments is different than others. In NBA, the length of the game is four 12-minutes quarters. As you know, there is no tie or draw in basketball. If the game is tied within the given time, then an additional five minutes is played.
Five minutes will be given to all overtime periods. Both the teams will be given 130 seconds break between first and second periods, also between third and fourth period. There will be 15 minutes break between halves.
2. Number of Players
Each team can put five players on the court at a time. But what if there comes a situation when a player receives his sixth personal foul and all the substitutes are disqualified?
Well, then the player can continue to play and will be charged with both the individual and team foul.
If one of the last eligible players is injured and he has to leave, then he will be replaced by the previous disqualified player who was disqualified for receiving his sixth foul.
3. Substitutes
As basketball requires a lot of running. So, it is evident that your team will need substitutes. Changing substitutes often keeps a team energetic, otherwise the players will not be able to play hard as their energy levels drop. Good news is the NBA does not have many restrictions regarding this.
During timeouts, teams can make substitutions as much as they want. But the substitute must be beckoned by an official. There are some exceptions as well. A substitute is not allowed to enter the game if there is a successful goal by either team.
Also, if there is any official’s suspension of play for unusual circumstance, substitutes cannot join their teammates.
4. Dribble
Good dribbling requires skill. It is the key thing that gives the upper hand to a player regarding scoring goals. If you can dribble well, you will be able to ditch the opponent players and make the way to score goals or assist your teammate to score goals.
While dribbling, a player cannot do certain things such as simultaneously touching the ball with both hands.
Additionally, if you are in the game, you cannot rest while possessing control over it. The dribbling of a player will end if he throws a pass, tries for scoring a field goal.
 Also, you cannot touch the ball more than one time, before it conducts with the floor.
5. Tie Score
What if your team plays hard, but in the end, both sides score the same? Would not that be painful to accept? Sports such as soccer, cricket allow tied scoring system to the same extent.
Fortunately, there is no tie in basketball. So, no matter what the score is, there must be a winning team. Therefore, at the end of given regulation, if the score is tied, additional five minutes’ overtime is played.
6. Three-Point Line
The three-point line is pretty long compared to the international events. In NBA, the line is 22’ in corners and 23’9” inches at the top.
7. Fouls
Fouls do not always count as bad for the defenders. Some fouls are so tricky that if anyone commits them, it does not let the opposing team scoring goals while not hurting the opponent player.
But, no matter what, if you make fouls, you have to pay the price sooner or later.
In NBA, if you make two technical fouls or six personal fouls, you will be disqualified.
As far as the shooting vs. non-shooting fouls concern, after fourth team foul, two free throws are given for each foul or the last two minutes of a quarter. It depends on whichever comes first.
The opponent team gets one free throw for a technical foul. The referee resumes the game at the point of interruption. The charges of foul are on specific individuals. 
8. Jump Ball and Alternating Possession
Taking possession on the ball is essential in basketball. The time in this game is not long, so the team who possesses the ball for most of the time, have a chance to win the game.
In NBA, it requires a jump ball to start the game. The team that loses initial jump ball gets the chance to possess the ball in the second and fourth quarters.
The team that wins initial jump gets ball possession in the third quarter. So, both the teams get the chance to start the ball equally.
9. Zone Defense
If the defense of a team is weak, the opponent gets more chance to attack and score goals. In college and high school basketball, you probably notice that there was a specific individual at zone defense.
But the thing is not the same in the NBA. A player cannot spend staying more than three seconds on the restrictive area unless he is guarding an opponent player.
10. Basket Interference
There will be no blocking of a ball with a downward flight towards the rim. The basket with its base has an imaginary cylinder has the basket with its support. If a player touches the ball while any part of it is still in the cylinder and has a chance to go, would be considered as a violation.
To conclude…
If you are a basketball fan and watch major basketball tournaments, then you must have noticed NBA has some different rules compared to FIBA, NCAA or even with Olympic basketball tournament.
Whether you are thinking about taking basketball as a profession or find interest to watch NBA tournaments, these are the basic rules of NBA basketball that you must know.
The rules of basketball are the rules and regulations that govern the play, officiating, equipment and procedures of basketball. While many of the basic rules are uniform throughout the world, variations do exist. Most leagues or governing bodies in North America, the most important of which are the National Basketball Association and NCAA, formulate their own rules. In addition, the Technical Commission of the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) determines rules for international play; most leagues outside North America use the complete FIBA ruleset.
On January 15, 1892, James Naismith published his rules for the game of "Basket Ball" that he invented:[1] The original game played under these rules was quite different from the one played today as there was no dribbling, dunking, three-pointers, or shot clock, and goal tending was legal.
